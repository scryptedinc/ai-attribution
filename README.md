# AI Attribution Standard

## Overview

This repository provides a standard for attributing AI-generated content in projects. The goal is to maintain transparency and proper recognition for the use of AI models in creating content.

## Motivation

With the increasing use of AI in content creation, it's essential to have a standardized way to attribute AI-generated contributions. This helps in maintaining transparency, ethical standards, and proper acknowledgment of the tools and technologies used.

## Usage Instructions

2. Customize the `AI.txt` file to include details specific to the AI models and content used in your project, specifically the 'Models', and 'Usage' sections.
3. Include a comment at the top of each file that contains AI-generated content, pointing to the `AI.txt` file for attribution details.

### Example Comment
```python
# This file includes AI-generated content. See the AI.txt file for details.
```

## Templates

The templates folder contains a customizable AI.txt source file that you can modify to suit your project's needs. Edit the lines as necessary.
